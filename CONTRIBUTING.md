## [crazy](https://nur-zaman.github.io/crazy/) about Contributions? 😵

Just like how we've delved into the [crazy](https://nur-zaman.github.io/crazy/) world of madness and rats, we're excited to invite you to join us on our journey. Your contributions, no matter how wild or quirky, are what make this project special. 😵

## Getting Started 🔒

Before you jump headfirst into contributing, please take a moment to review the following guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking our repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project that you can work on without affecting the main codebase.

2. **Clone the Repository**: After forking, clone the repository to your local machine to start making changes.

3. **Branch Out**: Create a new branch for your work. Be creative with your branch names, just like we were creative with our rubber room. 🏥

4. **Contribute**: Make your changes and contributions in your branch. Add new features, fix bugs, or suggest improvements – we love it all!

5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure your changes are thoroughly tested. We want your contributions to be as reliable as the rubber walls in our story.

6. **Pull Request**: Once you're confident in your contributions, create a pull request. We'll review your work, and together, we'll make sure it fits right into our project's [crazy](https://nur-zaman.github.io/crazy/) narrative.

7. **Be Patient**: We'll do our best to review your pull request as soon as possible, but please bear with us, just like we had to bear with the rats. 🐀

## Rubber Room with Rats 🏥🐀

Sometimes, just like our rubber room with rats, things can get a bit messy. Here's how you can make sure your contributions are welcomed with open arms:

- **Be Respectful**: Respect others' ideas, just like we respect the quirks of each rat in our room.

- **Document Your Work**: Please provide clear documentation for your contributions. This will help others understand your brilliant madness.

- **Follow the Style Guide**: Maintain a consistent style with the existing codebase. Contribute in harmony with the existing "[crazy](https://nur-zaman.github.io/crazy/)" theme.

## And Rats Make Me [crazy](https://nur-zaman.github.io/crazy/) 🐀

Your contributions, like those rats, have the potential to change the game. Embrace the quirkiness and the chaos that comes with creative contributions. We appreciate your efforts and your willingness to venture into our unique world.

Remember, the world perceives sanity differently, and we believe your contributions add to the wonderful tapestry of our project. 😵🏥🐀
